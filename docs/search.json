    "text": "ðŸ§¬ Species and Reference Genomes\nThis genome browser supports exploration of coral species included in our genomic analyses. For several species, direct reference genomes are not yet available. In these cases, we selected closely related species with high-quality assemblies as references, based on evolutionary proximity, morphological similarity, and assembly quality.\n\nðŸ”¹ Acropora pulchraðŸ”¹ Pocillopora tuahiniensisðŸ”¹ Porites evermanni\n\n\n\nReference Genome: Acropora millepora\nSource: NCBI PRJNA633778\nGenome Size: ~475 Mbp\nN50: 19.8 Mbp\nProtein-Coding Genes: 28,188\n\nAlthough A. pulchra does not have a published genome, A. millepora is used as a reference due to their close evolutionary relationship and documented ability to interbreed (Van Oppen et al., 2001, 2002).\n\n\n\n\nReference Genome: Pocillopora meandrina\nSource: Stephens et al., 2022\nGenome Size: ~377 Mbp\nN50: 10 Mbp\nProtein-Coding Genes: 31,840\n\nP. tuahiniensis does not yet have a published genome. P. meandrina was selected as a reference because of its morphological similarity and close evolutionary relationship. Although P. verrucosa is more closely related phylogenetically, P. meandrina provides a higher-quality assembly (N50 = 10 Mbp vs.Â 0.334 Mbp) and more comprehensive annotation.\n\n\n\n\nReference Genome: Porites evermanni\nSource: Genoscope Coral Genomes\nGenome Size: ~497 Mbp\nN50: 0.17 Mbp\nProtein-Coding Genes: 40,389\n\nThis genome was assembled from a sample collected in Moâ€™orea and is used directly in analyses without substitution."
